Absolutely! ‚ÄúMonitoring Pollution Drift Predictor‚Äù is a fantastic project idea‚Äîespecially for someone starting out. It blends environmental science, data analytics, and predictive modeling. Let‚Äôs break it down step-by-step so you can build it with clarity and confidence.

---

## üß≠ Project Overview

Your goal is to **monitor pollution levels** and **predict how pollution drifts** across regions over time. This could apply to air pollution, water pollution, or even soil contamination. For a beginner, I recommend starting with **air pollution**, as there‚Äôs more accessible data and simpler modeling techniques.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Components to Work On

### 1. **Problem Definition**
- Define what type of pollution you're tracking (e.g., PM2.5, NO‚ÇÇ, CO).
- Specify the geographic area (e.g., a city, industrial zone, or region).
- Clarify the goal: Is it real-time monitoring, forecasting future drift, or identifying pollution sources?

---

### 2. **Data Collection**
- **Sources**: Use open datasets like:
  - [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/)
  - [CPCB India](https://cpcb.nic.in/)
  - NASA EarthData (for satellite-based pollution data)
- **Types of Data**:
  - Pollution levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO‚ÇÇ, etc.)
  - Meteorological data (wind speed, direction, humidity, temperature)
  - Geographic data (latitude, longitude, elevation)

---

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
- Clean missing or inconsistent data.
- Normalize values for comparison.
- Merge pollution data with weather data using timestamps and location.

---

### 4. **Visualization Dashboard**
- Use tools like **Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)** or **Power BI/Tableau** to:
  - Show pollution levels over time.
  - Map pollution drift using wind direction.
  - Highlight hotspots and trends.

---

### 5. **Predictive Modeling**
- Start simple with **Linear Regression** or **Decision Trees**.
- For more accuracy, explore:
  - **Time Series Forecasting** (ARIMA, LSTM)
  - **Geospatial Modeling** (Kriging, Gaussian Processes)
- Input features: pollution levels, wind speed/direction, temperature.
- Output: predicted pollution concentration at a future time/location.

---

### 6. **Drift Simulation**
- Use wind vectors to simulate how pollution might move.
- Tools:
  - Python libraries like **Folium**, **GeoPandas**, or **Basemap**
  - GIS tools like **QGIS** or **Google Earth Engine**

---

### 7. **User Interface (Optional but Valuable)**
- Build a simple web app using:
  - **Streamlit** (easy for beginners)
  - **Flask/Django** (for more control)
- Allow users to select a location and see predicted pollution drift.

---

### 8. **Evaluation & Validation**
- Compare predictions with actual data.
- Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
- Validate with historical pollution events (e.g., Diwali spikes, crop burning periods).

---

### 9. **Documentation & Reporting**
- Keep a detailed log of:
  - Data sources and preprocessing steps
  - Model architecture and performance
  - Visualizations and insights
- Create a final report or presentation with:
  - Problem statement
  - Methodology
  - Results
  - Future scope

## üß™ 1. `model_exploration.ipynb`

This notebook is used to:
- Load and explore the dataset
- Preprocess features like wind direction
- Train a simple regression model
- Make predictions and visualize results

### Key Steps:
```python
from src.data_ingestion import load_data, preprocess_data
from src.drift_model import train_model, make_predictions
from src.visualizer import plot_drift

df = load_data('data/sample_inputs.csv')
df = preprocess_data(df)

# Train-test split
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X = df[['wind_speed', 'humidity', 'wind_angle']]
y = df['particulate_level']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train and predict
model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
predictions = make_predictions(model, X_test)

# Visualize
plot_drift(df)
```

---

## üì¶ 2. `drift_model.py`

This module contains two simple functions:

```python
def train_model(X, y):
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X, y)
    return model

def make_predictions(model, X_test):
    return model.predict(X_test)
```

### Explanation:
> This module isolates the model logic. It uses linear regression to predict particulate levels based on wind speed, humidity, and wind direction (converted to angle). Keeping it modular makes the code reusable and easy to test.

---

## üì• 3. `data_ingestion.py`

Handles loading and preprocessing:

```python
def load_data(filepath):
    import pandas as pd
    return pd.read_csv(filepath)

def preprocess_data(df):
    direction_map = {
        'N': 0, 'NE': 45, 'E': 90, 'SE': 135,
        'S': 180, 'SW': 225, 'W': 270, 'NW': 315
    }
    df['wind_angle'] = df['wind_direction'].map(direction_map)
    return df
```

### Explanation:
> This module loads the CSV file and converts wind direction into numeric angles. This helps the model understand directional data better. It keeps preprocessing separate from modeling for clarity.

---

## üìä 4. `visualizer.py`

Creates simple plots:

```python
def plot_drift(df):
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    sns.set(style="whitegrid")
    plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
    sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='wind_speed', y='particulate_level', hue='wind_direction')
    plt.title('Wind Speed vs Particulate Level')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
> This function visualizes how pollution levels vary with wind speed and direction. It helps interpret the data and validate model assumptions.

---

## üßæ 5. `requirements.txt`

Contains all the packages used:
```
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
```

### Explanation:
> This file ensures that anyone can recreate the same environment by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It keeps the project portable and reproducible.
