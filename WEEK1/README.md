# Week 1 – Pollution Drift Predictor (Environmental Monitoring & Pollution Control)

## 🌿 Project Theme
This project falls under the theme of **Environmental Monitoring & Pollution Control**, focusing on the prediction and analysis of airborne pollution drift using environmental data.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To explore and understand a real-world dataset related to air pollution, perform basic data analysis, and prepare the foundation for a predictive model that estimates pollution drift based on environmental factors.

---

## 📦 Dataset Used
- **Source:** Kaggle – [Air Pollution Analysis and Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/guidosalimbeni/air-pollution-analysis-and-prediction)
- **File:** `data.csv`
- **Size:** ~62 MB
- **Description:** Historical daily ambient air quality data across multiple Indian cities, including pollutants like SO₂, NO₂, PM2.5, and environmental features such as date, location, and state.

---

## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed using `week1_analysis.ipynb`:
- Imported necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`)
- Loaded dataset using `pd.read_csv()`
- Explored structure using:
  - `.info()` – to understand data types and non-null counts
  - `.describe()` – to view statistical summaries
  - `.isnull().sum()` – to identify missing values

---

## 🛠️ Improvisations Done
- Selected a dataset relevant to pollution drift and environmental monitoring
- Cleaned and explored the data using standard EDA techniques
- Identified key features for future modeling (e.g., pollutant levels, location, date)
- Structured the notebook with markdown explanations for clarity
