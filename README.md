# OVERVIEW
AI-based pollution drift forecasting for constructive sites. 


# Pollution Drift Predictor

An AI-powered system to forecast airborne pollution drift using environmental data such as wind speed, wind direction, humidity, and timestamp. Originally designed for construction sites, this tool has been generalized to support broader urban and industrial applications.
